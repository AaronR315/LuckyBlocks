LuckyBlocks
===========
A remake of the popular Lucky Block mod for Minecraft using Bukkit.

Can I help?
===========
Yes. Everything helps - bug reporting/fixing, feature suggesting(!), feature adding(yay c:), ect. Please report bugs here on github.

Hey, I have a lucky blocks bukkit mod too!
==========================================
Heck, if it's decent I'd be glad to switch my work to your mod instead of mine, or maybe you can switch. I didn't find any decent ones with a quick Google search (only one I found had 10 events or so).

WOW CAN I DOWNLOAD PLZ WHERE DOWNLOAD WOW
=========================================
You don't want this on your server yet. I'll have a proper build once you do.
