LuckyBlocks
===========
A remake of the popular Lucky Block mod for Minecraft using Bukkit. This aims to be a complete remake of the original mod, and maybe once I'm done with that I'll eventually add some of my own content too. I'd like to eventually add the luck system in, but that'll be a pain for a beginner like me.

Can I help?
===========
Yes. Everything helps - bug reporting/fixing, feature suggesting(!), feature adding(yay c:), ect. Please report bugs here on github.

Hey, I have a lucky blocks bukkit plugin too!
==========================================
Heck, if it's decent I'd be glad to switch my work to your mod instead of mine, or maybe you can switch. I didn't find any decent ones with a quick Google search (only one I found had 10 events or so).

WOW CAN I DOWNLOAD PLZ WHERE DOWNLOAD WOW
=========================================
You don't want this on your server yet. I'll have a proper build once you do.
